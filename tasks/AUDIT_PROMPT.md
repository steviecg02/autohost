# HostOS UI Audit Prompt

**Purpose**: Review the two planning documents that were just added to understand the product architecture and security approach.

---

## Documents to Audit

Two planning documents have been added to this repository from another conversation:

1. **[docs/planning/authentication-security-architecture.md](docs/planning/authentication-security-architecture.md)**
   - Authentication patterns (JWT, API keys, mTLS, OAuth2, etc.)
   - Multi-tenancy with org_id isolation
   - Secrets management (database encryption → secret store migration)
   - Implementation prompts for each service type
   - Security roadmap (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)

2. **[docs/planning/future-architecture-work-management.md](docs/planning/future-architecture-work-management.md)**
   - Tasks system (proposed, not finalized)
   - Workflows system (proposed, not finalized)
   - Projects system (proposed, not finalized)
   - AI agents (proposed approach)
   - Automation system (proposed)
   - Architectural questions (service boundaries, orchestration, etc.)

---

## Audit Tasks

**Please review both documents and provide feedback on**:

### 1. Authentication Architecture Audit

**Questions**:

- Does the JWT structure make sense for the platform?
- Are we missing any authentication patterns that should be considered?
- Is the secrets management roadmap reasonable?
- Should we prioritize mTLS sooner or later?
- Are the implementation prompts clear enough for each service?
- What security considerations are we missing?

**Look for**:

- Inconsistencies with existing product docs
- Missing authentication requirements
- Security vulnerabilities or risks
- Unclear implementation guidance

---

### 2. Work Management Architecture Audit

**⚠️ REMEMBER**: This document contains PROPOSALS from an AI brainstorming session, NOT finalized specs.

**Questions**:

- Do the proposed systems (tasks, workflows, projects, AI agents, automation) align with the product vision in [docs/product/PRODUCT_STORY.md](docs/product/PRODUCT_STORY.md) and [docs/product/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/product/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)?
- Are the use cases realistic for actual STR operators?
- Which architectural option makes the most sense?
  - Monolithic (all in org-service)?
  - Separate work-service?
  - Multiple specialized services?
- Should AI agents really be "users with roles" or should they be separate entities?
- Are we overcomplicating workflows? Could they be simpler?
- What's missing from the analysis?

**Look for**:

- Mismatch with product vision
- Overcomplicated solutions
- Missing requirements
- Unrealistic assumptions
- Better architectural approaches

---

### 3. Integration Audit

**Questions**:

- How do these two documents fit together with the existing product docs?
- Are there conflicts or inconsistencies?
- What should be moved/merged/deleted?
- What's still missing?

---

## Output Format

Please provide:

1. **Summary**: High-level assessment of both documents
2. **Authentication Feedback**: Specific issues/questions/recommendations
3. **Work Management Feedback**: Specific issues/questions/recommendations
4. **Integration Issues**: Conflicts with existing docs
5. **Recommendations**: What to do next with these documents

---

## Context

These documents came from a conversation about:

- Implementing JWT authentication in org-service and sync services
- Planning future work management features
- Answering architectural questions about service boundaries

The authentication stuff is being implemented NOW.

The work management stuff is FUTURE - needs validation before building.
